# First Assignment of the Research Track 2 course 

In this assignment, starting from the initial package which you can find in the repository https://github.com/CarmineD8/rt2_assignment1 two different versions have been created which you can find in the [action](https://github.com/piquet8/rt2_assignment1/tree/action) branch and the [ros2](https://github.com/piquet8/rt2_assignment1/tree/ros2) branch. In addition, a [Vrep scene](https://github.com/piquet8/rt2_assignment1/blob/main/coppeliascene.ttt) containing a robot interacting with the simulation was implemented in the [main](https://github.com/piquet8/rt2_assignment1/tree/main) branch.  


The package contains the nodes and the simulation environment for controlling a mobile robot in the Gazebo simulation environment.
To launch the node, please run:
```
roslaunch rt2_assignment1 sim.launch
```
